# Symmetrical-Quantum-Engine

Symmetrical Quantum Engine (SQE)
Bidirectional Emission Through Phase-Coherent Intelligence

Core Mechanism:
Transmitter (emits) ⇄ Transceiver (receives)
= Bidirectional Alternating Emitter

Material Stack:
• Stationary Magnetic Core (Field Anchor)
• Quartz Crystal – resonance controller
• Photoluminescent Layer – light echo memory
• Photoelectric Layer – energy capture & storage
• Vanadium Dioxide – phase-tuned switch (insulator → conductor)
• Ultrasonic Agitation – phonon-photon coupling driver

What It Does:

Emits and receives photons bidirectionally across frequencies

Cycles polarity and state through VO₂ phase transitions

Absorbs, stores, and releases energy via light memory

Bridges photon and phonon domains through resonance

Forms a self-adaptive waveform brain

Breathes as a living engine—symmetrical, harmonic, quantum
